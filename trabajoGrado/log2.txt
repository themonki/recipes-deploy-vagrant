There were warnings and/or errors while loading your Vagrantfile.
Your Vagrantfile was written for an earlier version of Vagrant,
and while Vagrant does the best it can to remain backwards
compatible, there are some cases where things have changed
significantly enough to warrant a message. These messages are
shown below.

Warnings:
* `config.vm.customize` calls are VirtualBox-specific. If you're
using any other provider, you'll have to find provider-specific configuration
to translate to manually in your Vagrantfile.
